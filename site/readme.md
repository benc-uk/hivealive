# Node.js Express Boilerplate
Simple skeleton app for web projects. Includes:
- Express
- EJS templates
- Bootstrap 3.3 (With Flatly Bootswatch theme)
- jQuery 3.2
- Font Awesome 4.7

Routes are loaded dynamically from the `/routes` folder, all files in there should export a router to be applied

## Getting Started
- Edit [locals.js](locals.js) to configure
- Modify [routes](/routes), either one file per route or multiple, whatever works!
- Put static content (CSS, JS, images) in [/public](/public) 
- Put EJS template views in [/views](/views)
